# Gemini Clone

## Project Overview

Gemini Clone is a web application that mimics a chat interface similar to Google's Gemini. It allows users to interact with a generative language model, view suggestions, and toggle between light and dark themes. The app fetches responses from a generative language API and displays them with a typing effect.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Users can send messages and receive responses from an AI model.
- **Suggestions**: Predefined suggestions for quick interactions.
- **Theming**: Toggle between light and dark modes.
- **Message Copying**: Copy messages to the clipboard.
- **Chat Management**: Save and delete chat history.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- Node.js (optional for local development).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Add Your API Key**

   Replace the placeholder API key in `script.js` with your own API key.

   ```javascript
   const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
   ```

3. **Open the Project**

   Open `index.html` in your web browser.

   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

## Usage

1. **Interact with the Chat Interface**
